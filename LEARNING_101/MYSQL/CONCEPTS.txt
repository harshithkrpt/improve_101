Advanced Concepts To Master : 


1. Advanced Aggregation & Window Functions
    Move beyond GROUP BY to row-level comparisons and ranking.
    Learn:
    ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()
    PARTITION BY
    Running totals, moving averages
    LEAD(), LAG() for "previous/next row" logic

2. Case Expressions & Conditional Aggregates
    CASE WHEN logic inside SELECT
    Conditional SUM, COUNT, AVG

3. Data Modeling Concepts
    Understand:
        Normalization vs Denormalization
        Primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints
        Indexing strategy
        Composite keys
        Table relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N)

4. Views, CTEs (WITH Clauses), and Temp Tables
    Learn:
        WITH (Common Table Expressions) for query readability
        When to use a VIEW
        Temporary tables for complex reports

5. Performance Optimization
        Index types (BTree, Fulltext)
        EXPLAIN plans
        When to avoid SELECT *
        Query rewriting for speed


6. Data Manipulation & Transactions
    INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE best practices
    Transactions: BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
    Using ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE and REPLACE INTO

7. Stored Procedures & Triggers
    Create procedures for repeated logic
    Define triggers to auto-update fields (e.g., audit logs)
