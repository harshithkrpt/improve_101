-> what are the key aspects of system design ?
-> The key aspects of system design include:
    -> Scalability: The ability of the system to handle increasing amounts of traffic or data.
    -> Reliability: The ability of the system to function correctly and consistently.
    -> Availability: The ability of the system to be accessible to users when they need it.
    -> Maintainability: The ability of the system to be easily updated and modified.
    -> Performance: The ability of the system to respond quickly to user requests.
    -> Security: The ability of the system to protect data from unauthorized access.
    -> Cost: The cost of building and operating the system.
