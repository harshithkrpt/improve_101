# OSI Model (7 Layers)

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is a 7-layer framework for standardizing network communications. It was developed in 1977 and adopted as an ISO standard in 1984. Each layer provides specific services to the layer above it and relies on the layer below, creating a clear modular structure for networking. The seven layers, from top (7) to bottom (1), are depicted below:

```
Application (Layer 7)
↓
Presentation (Layer 6)
↓
Session      (Layer 5)
↓
Transport    (Layer 4)
↓
Network      (Layer 3)
↓
Data Link    (Layer 2)
↓
Physical     (Layer 1)
```

| Layer | Name           | Key Responsibilities / Examples |
|:------|:---------------|:---------------------------------|
| 7     | **Application** | Interface for end-user services (e.g. web, email). Protocols like HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS. |
| 6     | **Presentation** | Data formatting and encryption (e.g. ASCII/EBCDIC translation, SSL). |
| 5     | **Session**      | Managing dialogues between applications (sessions, check-pointing). Example protocols: RPC, NetBIOS, X.225. |
| 4     | **Transport**    | End-to-end data transport, reliability and flow control. Protocols: TCP, UDP, SCTP. |
| 3     | **Network**      | Path selection and logical addressing (IP routing). Protocols: IP (IPv4/v6), ICMP, routing (RIP/OSPF). |
| 2     | **Data Link**    | Framing, error detection/correction, and local medium access control. Technologies: Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), PPP; devices: switches, bridges. |
| 1     | **Physical**     | Raw bit transmission over cables or wireless. Defines electrical/optical signals and hardware (cables, hubs, repeaters). |

## Layer 1: Physical Layer

Defines the hardware means of transmitting raw bits over a physical medium. This includes electrical/optical specifications, connectors, cables, and signaling methods.

- **Functions:** Bit-level transmission, modulation, line coding, synchronization.
- **Examples:** Ethernet PHY (10BASE-T, 100BASE-FX), DSL, USB, Wi-Fi.
- **Devices:** Cables, hubs, repeaters, transceivers.

## Layer 2: Data Link Layer

Provides reliable node-to-node data transfer and medium access control.

- **Functions:** Framing, error detection/correction, flow control, MAC.
- **Examples:** Ethernet, PPP, HDLC, ARP.
- **Devices:** Switches, bridges, NICs.
- **Analogy:** Like a neighborhood traffic cop.

## Layer 3: Network Layer

Handles logical addressing and routing of packets across networks.

- **Functions:** IP addressing, routing, packet forwarding, fragmentation.
- **Examples:** IP (IPv4/v6), ICMP, IGMP, RIP, OSPF, BGP.
- **Devices:** Routers, layer-3 switches.

## Layer 4: Transport Layer

Provides end-to-end communication and reliability between hosts.

- **Functions:** Segmentation, error recovery, flow control, ports.
- **Examples:** TCP, UDP, SCTP.
- **Services:** Reliable or best-effort delivery.

## Layer 5: Session Layer

Manages sessions or dialogs between applications.

- **Functions:** Session initiation, maintenance, termination, checkpoints.
- **Examples:** RPC, NetBIOS, PPTP, X.225.
- **Analogy:** Like a phone call that can pause and resume.

## Layer 6: Presentation Layer

Responsible for data representation, compression, and encryption.

- **Functions:** Encoding/decoding, syntax translation, encryption, compression.
- **Examples:** SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG, ASCII/EBCDIC translation.
- **Analogy:** Like a translator or interpreter.

## Layer 7: Application Layer

Provides network services directly to user applications.

- **Functions:** Interface for end-user network access, file transfer, email, browsing.
- **Examples:** HTTP, FTP, SMTP, IMAP, DNS, SSH, SNMP.
- **Analogy:** User-facing services and APIs.
