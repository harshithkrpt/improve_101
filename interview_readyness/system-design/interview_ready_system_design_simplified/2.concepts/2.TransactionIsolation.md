# 🔒 Transaction Isolation Levels in Databases

Transaction isolation levels define how/when the changes made by one operation become visible to others. They control **concurrency** and help avoid **anomalies** like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

## 🔁 ANSI SQL Standard Isolation Levels

| Level | Dirty Read | Non-Repeatable Read | Phantom Read |
|-------|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Read Uncommitted** | ✅ Possible | ✅ Possible | ✅ Possible |
| **Read Committed**   | ❌ Prevented | ✅ Possible | ✅ Possible |
| **Repeatable Read**  | ❌ Prevented | ❌ Prevented | ✅ Possible |
| **Serializable**     | ❌ Prevented | ❌ Prevented | ❌ Prevented |

---

## 🔹 1. Read Uncommitted

- **Lowest level** of isolation.
- Transactions can read **uncommitted changes** from others.
- Fastest, but **unsafe** for critical applications.

🔸 Issues:
- Dirty Reads
- Non-Repeatable Reads
- Phantom Reads

---

## 🔹 2. Read Committed

- A transaction only reads **committed data**.
- Default in many databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, Oracle).

🔸 Issues Prevented:
- ❌ Dirty Reads  
🔸 Still Possible:
- ✅ Non-Repeatable Reads  
- ✅ Phantom Reads

---

## 🔹 3. Repeatable Read

- Ensures that **if a row is read twice**, it won’t change during the transaction.
- Uses **shared locks** on read rows.

🔸 Issues Prevented:
- ❌ Dirty Reads  
- ❌ Non-Repeatable Reads  
🔸 Still Possible:
- ✅ Phantom Reads (new rows matching condition may appear)

---

## 🔹 4. Serializable

- **Highest level** of isolation.
- Transactions are executed as if **serialized** (one after the other).
- Prevents **all anomalies**, but comes with **performance cost**.

🔸 Prevents:
- Dirty Reads  
- Non-Repeatable Reads  
- Phantom Reads

---

## 🧪 Common Anomalies

| Anomaly | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dirty Read** | Reading uncommitted changes of another transaction |
| **Non-Repeatable Read** | Same query gives different results within a transaction |
| **Phantom Read** | New rows appear in repeated queries within a transaction |

---

## 💡 Isolation in Popular Databases

| DBMS | Default Isolation Level |
|------|--------------------------|
| PostgreSQL | Read Committed |
| MySQL (InnoDB) | Repeatable Read |
| SQL Server | Read Committed |
| Oracle | Read Committed (Serializable via Serializable mode) |

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Use **Read Uncommitted** for maximum concurrency (rare).
- **Read Committed** is safe for many use cases.
- Use **Repeatable Read** or **Serializable** when consistency is critical.
- Higher isolation = fewer anomalies, but more locking & slower performance.
