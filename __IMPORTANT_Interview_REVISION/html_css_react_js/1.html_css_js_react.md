## 🧠 FRONTEND INTERVIEW REVISION BLUEPRINT

### 🔹 HTML — Semantic, Accessibility, and Performance

**Concepts to Revise**
- Semantic HTML5 tags (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`)
- Forms: validation attributes (`required`, `pattern`, `novalidate`)
- Accessibility (a11y): `aria-label`, roles, tab order, landmarks
- SEO: meta tags, title, canonical, Open Graph
- `<script>` attributes: `defer` vs `async`
- Storage: LocalStorage vs SessionStorage vs Cookies
- Shadow DOM and Web Components
- Critical Rendering Path

**Deep Knowledge**
- `<link rel="preload">` vs `<link rel="prefetch">`
- How browsers parse HTML → DOM
- CSR vs SSR HTML structures

---

### 🎨 CSS — Layout, Architecture, and Optimization

**Core Concepts**
- Box model (margin collapsing, `box-sizing`)
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Positioning: relative, absolute, sticky, fixed
- Specificity, inheritance, cascade layers
- Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`)
- Responsive design, media queries
- CSS units: `em`, `rem`, `%`, `vh`, `vw`
- CSS transitions, keyframe animations
- CSS architecture: BEM, CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind
- Repaint vs Reflow (render performance)

**Tricky Topics**
- Difference: `visibility: hidden` vs `opacity: 0` vs `display: none`
- Why avoid inline styles
- GPU acceleration: `will-change`, `transform: translateZ(0)`

---

### ⚙️ JavaScript — ES6+ and Core Mechanics

**ES6+ Features**
- `let`, `const`, block scoping, TDZ

- Arrow functions (`this` binding)
- Promises, async/await, event loop
- Modules (`import/export`, dynamic imports)
- Default parameters, enhanced object literals
- Generators & Iterators
- Classes, private fields (`#`)
- Optional chaining (`?.`), nullish coalescing (`??`)

**Core JS Concepts**

  - `usePrevious`
  - `useTimeout`
  - `useLocalStorage`

**Key Points**
